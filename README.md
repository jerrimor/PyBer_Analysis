# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The analysis was completed to find differences within the data between ride sharing data by city type over time.  The request was to separate the data into weeks to help illustrate the success rate of ride sharing among urban, suburban and rural cities.  The PyBer organization would like to use this analysis to better understand what access improvements are needed for under-served communities, as well as understand the affordability for these same communities.  

## Results

The summary shows the comparison between the rides, drivers and fares.  As seen in the table, the total rides for the Urban cities is thirteen times more than in the rural cities.  The large difference is also seen in the number of drivers between the urban and rural cities.  There are far less rides provided to the rural areas.  The average cost for rides in the rural cities is however higher, by $10. Also, the chart indicates that the average fare per driver is over three times larger for the rural cities compared to the urban average fare amount.

The mutiple line graph was created with only the first quarter data.  The large difference between urban and rural fares is quite clear in the chart.  The pattern of usage throughout the weeks/months is comparable between all three city types, urban, suburban and rural.  They all see an increase in fares in late February.  The urban fares far exceed those of the rural city type.  


## Summary
The rural city type has a significantly lower number of rides, lower number of drivers and lower total fares compared to both the urban and suburban city types.  The urban city types leads all the types in fares, rides and drivers.  While the suburban type falls right in the middle of the three types.  The low usage of PyBer in rural areas could be due to the scarcity of drivers but could also be as a result of the high average cost to utilize their services. My business recommendations are as follows: 
1. Increase the driver count in rural cities.  The low ride count would be directly related to the low number of drivers in these areas.  Customers will turn to PyBer for ride-share services if there is a quick response to their online request for a driver and when they see a larger coverage area for the services.  
2. Lower the fares in the rural cities.  Rural areas indicate that there are little to no businesses in the area so a typical ride-share customer will most likley need to travel a longer distance, than a customer in an urban or suburban city.  This long distance ride would increase their average ride fare.  If the ride-share service is more affordable to those in the rural cities, there would be an increase in utilization.  
3. Increase the driver count in the urban cities.  The amount of rides is large and the driver count is also large, however the average fare per driver is low.  There is a gap in return on each ride when the number of rides is large but the fares are low.
